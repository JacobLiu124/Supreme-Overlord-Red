The supremacy of Christ is a doctrine surrounding the authority of Jesus and His God-nature. In the simplest of terms, to affirm the supremacy of Christ is to affirm that Jesus is God.
Colossians 1:15

If Christ is supreme then anything goes who am I to say to God, "wait a min GOD I gotta do this quickly, or I gotta do uni first or school or whatever, make my first 100K then follow you". The disciples when called by Jesus got up and left everything they had to follow Jesus. Will you too?
